# P3

## Running with Bash Script

Note: The script assumes you have the ./dist/MDELite6.jar file or have already set the CLASSPATH.

You can run the program on all files within the P3Examples folder with

```
./run.sh
```
or run individual files 
```
./run.sh [filename]
```
for example
```
./run.sh hard
```
